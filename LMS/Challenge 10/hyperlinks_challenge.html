    <h1>Daniel Hawes</h1>
    <p>During this last 2 weeks i actually learnt alot of new things of how to create a website and alos learning more about myslef in the 2week life skills session. So this last 2 weeks on html was a nice experience, cause i found out stuff i could create and how easy is it to create. We leanrt about html and how to create headers in html as in what the topic is about, and also found out how to create a title for the webpage we designing. </p>

    <p>It actually excites one to be in this field when learning about coding and what is coding and creating things. Me personally i never had the passion for coding but now that i learnt just the basics and it really started making me think about my future as a web developer.</p>

    <p>We alos have a professional development class where we find ourself and what values we can up hold in a working. Also thinking, as in designthinking we did this week. its how we can look at things from a different side and thinlk about it differently and actually thinking much deeper and how we can create the changes we want to make.</p>
